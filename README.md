FraudGuard is a behavior-based, explainable credit card fraud detection system built using machine learning. It identifies suspicious
transactions by analyzing transaction behavior and assigns a fraud risk score similar to real-world banking systems.

Objective

-Detect fraudulent transactions using ML

-Handle highly imbalanced fraud data

-Generate risk scores instead of only 0/1 predictions

-Explain model decisions using SHAP

Key Features

-Behavior-based feature engineering (time, velocity, amount deviation)

-Random Forest model for fraud detection

-Risk-based decision system (Low / Medium / High)

-Explainable AI using SHAP

-Streamlit UI for local demonstration
